## Bamazon Application

1. Create a Database called `bamazon`.
2. Populate this database with around 10 different products. (i.e. Insert "mock" data rows into this database and table).
3. Then create a Node application called `bamazonCustomer.js`. Running this application will first display all of the items
Include the ids, names, and prices of products for sale.
4. The app should then prompt users with two messages.
   * The first should ask them the ID of the product they would like to buy.
   * The second message should ask how many units of the product they would like to buy.
5. Once the customer has placed the order, your application should check if your store has enough of the product
   * If not, the app should log a phrase like `Insufficient quantity!`, and then prevent the order from going through
8. However, if your store _does_ have enough of the product, you should fulfill the customer's order.
   * This means updating the SQL database to reflect the remaining quantity.
   * Once the update goes through, show the customer the total cost of their purchase.
   
   
   **I have not had the time to really get this working. I have stared the DataBase and put the products in the dataBase but have yet
   **to code out the running application, I will continue to work on this.
